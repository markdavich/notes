## Obstacles
- Environmental distractions
- Technological distractions
- Personal/emotional factors

Become aware of these obstacles and actively identify them

### Environmental Distractions
- Hi paced
- Remote work

### Technological Distractions
- Terminology
- Over reliance on digital communication
- Missing non-verbal ques
### Personal/Emotional Factors
- Lack of training on soft skills

## Exercise in Practice

### Presence and Focus
Frequently undervalued. People miss important facts.   

#### In Practice
Take a 1 minute moment of silence before a meeting, this allows participants to  
acknowledge and accept their current state. After this each
person makes a commitment (sets an intentions) to be fully present during the meeting  

If you find yourself loosing focus or getting distracted, gently come back to the  
present moment. Minimize distractions (close tabs, windows, phones)

### Replace Snap Judgments with Curiosity
1. Identify judgment moment
2. Pause and reflect
   1. Don't accept the judgment as truth
3. Formulate curious question
   1. If you *feel* someone is being negative, ask yourself "I wonder what is causing  
      this person to feel this way?" Keep it in mind to guide your 
      I've notices you seem concerned about this issues...

### Three Minute Pause
1. Identify judgment and assumptions
2. Recognize preconceived notions or bias
3. focus on facts
4. Be aware of their immediate reactions

## Third Pillar of Mindful Communication
### Self Regulation and Empathy
#### The Response Wait Rule
Wait 30 minutes to an hours when responding to emotionally charged messages  
1. Acknowledge initial emotional response
2. Do a different activity and return when calmer
3. Re-read to understand senders perspective
4. Respond without influences of emotions

## Transcript of Course
Have you ever found yourself responding to a colleague without fully grasping the conversation because you were overwhelmed with emails and other tasks? Or maybe you've reacted quickly to someone's remarks only to later wish you had taken more time to consider your response? How often do you struggle to maintain focus in discussions with your thoughts drifting off to different concerns? It's worth considering how these patterns of impatience and distraction might affect not just your work relationships but also your personal connections, and that's where the practice of mindful communication comes in. Hello. I'm Vesna Lakovic van Kempen, a certified mindful trainer with nearly a decade of experience in this field. I've been teaching both individuals and groups across various companies, organizations, and institutions worldwide. While mindfulness has become a trendy term, often thrown around in social media hashtags like be present or live in the moment, its real depth is much more significant and applicable to our daily lives than many realize. It's not just a trendy concept. It has practical relevance in both our personal and professional lives. In this talk, we'll explore the basics of mindful communication, what is it and why it matters in the workplace, the main elements that make up mindful communication, identifying what gets in the way of mindful communication, real examples and exercises to apply these concepts. So, let's dive in. To understand what mindful communication is, let's start with defining what mindfulness is. A simple definition of mindfulness from Jon Kabat‑Zinn, the creator of the mindfulness‑based stress reduction, MBSR, program, is paying attention to the present moment nonjudgmentally. Mindful communication, therefore, involves applying this practice of mindfulness to our interactions and relationships with others. Let's contrast this with what often happens in regular communication. Imagine a scenario with Tom, an IT project manager who is often caught up in the autopilot reactive mode of communication. During a critical team meeting, one of his team members, Nadia, brings up a potential issue with the project timeline. Tom, while simultaneously checking his emails and thinking about his next meeting, thinking that he's being productive, quickly dismisses Nadia's concern without fully absorbing the details. His response is habitual, we'll deal with it later, not truly engaging with the specific concerns Nadia raised. This lack of attentive listening and immediate unconsidered reply leads to overlooking a critical issue that later escalates, causing project delays and increased team tension. If Tom had utilized mindful communication, the scenario would have played out differently. Upon Nadia raising the concern, he would have paused his email checking, directed his full attention to her, and actively listened to understand the depth of the issue. He would have acknowledged her concern, asked clarifying questions, and discussed potential solutions or at least assured her of revisiting the issue with the attention it deserved. This mindful approach would not only have prevented the project delay, but also would have built trust and respect within the team, showing that he values their input and is generally engaged in the project success. Now, let's look at another example of reactive communication. Consider a scenario involving Derek, a software team lead who often falls into the trap of reactive communication, especially under stress. In a meeting, his team presents a new approach that deviates from the original plan. Feeling the pressure of deadlines and unprepared for the change, Derek quickly reacts with frustration. He sharply criticized the idea, dismissing it without fully understanding the reasoning behind it. His response, driven by impatience and stress, shuts down further discussion and leaves his team feeling demoralized and hesitant to share innovative ideas in the future. If Derek had approached the situation with mindful communication, the outcome would have been more positive. On hearing the new approach instead of immediately reacting, he would take a moment to manage his initial impulse of frustration. He would listen to his team's idea with patience and openness, considering the potential benefits of their approach. Even if he had reservations, he would express them respectfully, encouraging a dialogue to understand better and evaluate the idea in more detail. This empathetic and respectful communication style would foster a supportive environment, encouraging creativity and collaboration and making team members feel valued and heard. So let's conclude, what is mindful communication? Mindful communication involves engaging in conversations with full attention, intention, and empathy. It enhances both professional and personal interactions by promoting focus and presence. This approach builds stronger, more meaningful relationships and fosters empathy, leading to more thoughtful responses and less impulsivity. It also reduces prejudice, respects differences, and creates a more inclusive and genuine interaction environment. To clarify it better, I've highlighted the key components essential in practicing mindful communication. Let's explore these components in more depth to understand the advantages they offer in everyday communication. First component is presence and focus. Presence and focus refer to the ability to be fully attentive and engaged in the moment during a conversation. It means paying complete attention to the speaker, not just to the words being said, but also to the nonverbal cues like tone and body language. This improves insight, reduces misunderstandings, and builds stronger relationships. In a world of constant distractions, showing genuine focus and presence is essential for fostering trust and respect. Second component is nonjudgment and active listening. Nonjudgment involves listening to others without jumping to conclusions or allowing personal biases to color your interpretation. Active listening is a deeper level of listening where you're not only hearing the words but also understanding the emotions and intentions behind them. In communication, this component fosters openness, deepens empathy, and facilitates effective problem solving by ensuring all perspectives are considered. And the third component is self‑regulation and empathy. Self‑regulation refers to the ability to manage your own emotional responses, particularly in high stress or emotionally charged situations. Empathy is the capacity to understand and share the feelings of another person, putting yourself in their shoes. This helps prevent conflict escalation, creates a supportive and empathetic environment, and improves teamwork and collaboration in the workplace. I recognize that while the concept of mindful communication is positive and empowering, implementing it can be challenging, especially in tech‑related environments where these challenges are often more pronounced. To address these issues effectively and understand them from various perspectives, let's examine the obstacles we encounter closely. Awareness of these barriers allow us to identify and implement appropriate solutions and strategies more effectively. These obstacles typically fall into three main categories, environmental distractions, technological distractions, and personal factors. So, which are the environmental distractions? Environmental distractions include fast‑paced work environment, which creates tension, stress, and hinders mindful communication, remote or distributed themes where geographic and time zone differences limit real‑time and in‑person interactions, cultural differences in diverse workplaces, potentially leading to misunderstandings and communication gaps. Beside this, we can also face technological distractions. Some of those are overreliance on digital communication, causing personal disconnection and misunderstandings, use of technical terminology, creating language barriers, which might exclude colleagues not familiar with such language, challenges in virtual communication where missing nonverbal cues hinder emotional and intentional understanding. Additionally, personal factors pose significant challenges to practicing mindful communication, such as multitasking, leading to reduced presence, lack of training in soft skill skills. A focus on technical skills at the expense of soft skills like communication and empathy can hinder effective interaction. A person's high workload causes stress, which can diminish mental clarity and the capacity to communicate effectively. By identifying and understanding the specific barriers to mindful communication, you gain insight into your personal challenges in this area. This awareness allows you to strategically focus on key areas, modifying environmental factors, like reducing external distractions, developing empathy and appreciation for diverse perspectives among global colleagues, or refining your personal habits. Many of these obstacles can be effectively addressed through the upcoming exercise I'll introduce. So, how can we practice mindful communication? Let me introduce you to several exercises aimed at strengthening mindful communication, which can be used in teams or individually. These exercises are categorized in three key components, presence and focus, nonjudgment and active listening, self‑regulation and empathy. Let's begin with presence and focus. Presence and focus stand as important elements of mindful communication, yet they are frequently undervalued and overlooked in many conversations, both in professional and personal settings. To illustrate the significance of this component, consider the following scenario. During a weekly software development team meeting, Anika presents an update on her project segment. However, her colleagues are largely distracted. Some are checking emails, others are preparing for their updates, and a few are occupied with their phones. Consequently, they miss the critical points about the potential delays due to a technical issue that Anika highlights. Two days later, this overlooked issue escalates, catching the team of guard. This results in a hasty and stressful effort to resolve the problem, a situation that could have been proactively managed with full attention during the meeting. This lack of focus not only leads to project delays but also heightened stress and frustration within the team. How can we prevent this from happening and be more present and focused in our communication? Let's start with a mindful listening exercise. To incorporate mindful listening into group settings or individual practices, begin meetings with a minute of silence. This allows participants to acknowledge and accept their current mental state, whether it's stress, prick with patience, or distractions. Techniques like focusing on breath, bodily sensations, or surrounding sounds can be used to calm down the mind and shift attention from external thoughts. After this mindful minute, each person sets an intention to remain fully present during the meeting. Throughout the meeting, it's important to recognize when your mind starts to wander or when distractions arise. Instead of criticizing yourself, gently redirect your focus back to the present moment and the ongoing discussion. Participants should minimize potential distractions such as turning off phones or closing unrelated tabs, particularly in remote settings. Each speaker gets time to express thoughts without interruption, ensuring complete communication of ideas. Listeners should focus on understanding the speaker message without planning a response, allowing for deeper comprehension. The second suggestion is exercise mindful email activity. The mindful email activity is designed to enhance mindfulness and focus during routine tasks like checking emails. This exercise is more than just improving email efficiency. It aims to boost overall focus and concentration. So start by pausing before begin the activity, preparing your mind for a mindful approach. Engage in deep breathing to center your thoughts and calm your mind. Then mentally set your goal to stay focused on checking emails. As you go through your emails, do so with full attention, being aware of each action from clicking on an email to reading and responding. Recognize when your attention drifts. And without judgment, bring your focus back to your emails. This practice not only improves email handling, but also enhances listening and comprehension skills in conversations, training your mind to stay present and attentive, leading to better understanding and reduced distractions. Another crucial component of mindful communication is nonjudgment and active listening. Our diverse backgrounds, cultures, life experiences, and histories often shape our perceptions leading to preconceived notions and biases. To illustrate this point, let's consider the following story. In a health care team meeting, Dr. Lee proposes a new approach to patient care. However, her colleagues already having preconceived notions about her unconventional methods start to tune out before she finishes. They quickly dismiss her ideas based on past experiences rather than current merits. The team leader, sensing the group's skepticism, shifts the discussion to a different topic. Dr. Lee, feeling disregarded and marginalized, becomes reluctant to share future ideas. This reaction not only affects her morale, but also deprives the team of potentially innovative patient care strategies that could benefit their practice. So consider these exercises to strengthen this component. The first one is replacing snap judgments with curiosity. The primary goal of this exercise is to transform the automatic habit of making quick judgments about people or situations into a practice of exploration. First step would be to identify the judgment moment. Be aware of when you're making a snap judgment. This could be a thought like this person is always so negative or they probably don't know what they're talking about. Then pause and reflect. Instead of accepting this judgment as truth, take a moment to pause. Recognize that this is your perception, not necessarily the reality. Third step would be formulating a curious question. Transform the judgment into a question aimed at understanding. For example, if you think someone is being negative, ask yourself, I wonder what's causing them to see things this way? Use this question in your interaction. In your next interaction with the person, you can use this question either directly by asking them if appropriate or keep it in mind to guide your listening and responses. For example, I've noticed you seem concerned about this issue. Can you share more about your perspective? The next exercise is 3‑minute pause. It involves taking a 3‑minute reflection break after someone speaks or presents a point in a meeting. During this pause, participants actively reflect on what was just said, separating their personal judgments and assumptions from the facts presented by the speaker. This reflective process involves identifying judgments and assumptions, recognizing any preconceived notions or biases they might have about the topic or the speaker, focusing on the facts, concentrating on the actual content of what was shared, separating it from any emotional or subjective responses, mindful awareness, being aware of their immediate reactions and questioning whether these are based on the present information or influenced by unrelated facts. This exercise helps minimize impulsive reactions by encouraging participants to pause and reflect, reducing responses influenced by biases or assumptions. Now, let's explore the third pillar of mindful communication, self‑regulation and empathy. Before delving into detailed exercises, we'll first understand its significance through a story, highlighting how these skills impact team dynamics and relationships. In a small graphic design agency, the team receives critical feedback from a major client about their project. Layla, a lead designer, reacts defensively and hastily sends an email back arguing against the client's suggestions and emphasizing the project's artistic integrity. Layla does this without discussing it with her team or manager. This impulsive response marked by a lack of self‑regulation and empathy damages the client relationship and creates internal team tension as Layla's approach fails to consider the client's perspective or seek collaborative solutions with her team. Here are some exercises which can help you improve these skills. The response wait rule enhances communication by regulating emotional reactions to stressful emails or messages. Implement this as a personal or team‑wide rule where everyone agrees to wait 30 minutes to an hour before responding to emotionally charged messages. Adjust the waiting period as needed. Upon receiving such a message, acknowledge your initial emotional response. Then, take a break. Engage in activities like a short walk or deep breathing to emotionally distance yourself. Return to the message when calmer. Reread it to understand the sender's perspective. And then compose a response that is logical and professional, not dictated by initial emotions. This method, when adopted collectively, fosters a more thoughtful and composed communication culture in the workplace. Another effective exercise for emotional self‑regulation is the RAIN technique developed by meditation teacher Michelle McConald. This method offers a structured approach to managing challenging emotions and thoughts. Here are the steps. Recognize. Notice what is happening within you. Identify any troubling thoughts, feelings, or sensations without judgment. Accept. Accept the experience as it is without trying to change it. Understand that it's okay to have these feelings or thoughts. Investigate. Gently explore, why are you feeling this way? Ask yourself, what's triggering these emotions? And observe your reactions with kindness and curiosity. Nonidentification. Realize that these emotions and thoughts are not a permanent part of you. You are not your feelings. They are temporary and will pass. Practicing RAIN can help you in managing difficult emotions, leading to greater self‑regulation and mindfulness in daily life. If you're interested in more self‑regulation exercises, I invite you to check out my other talk on the topic of managing emotional exhaustion. In conclusion, mindful communication is a vital skill in today's fast‑paced workplace. It revolves around being present and focused, engaging in nonjudgmental and active listening, and practicing self‑regulation and empathy. These elements not only foster a more harmonious work environment, but also lead to more effective and meaningful interactions. We've explored how various distractions whether environmental, technological, or stemming from personal habits can disturb this type of communication. Recognizing these barriers is the first step towards overcoming them. By incorporating practical exercises for each of the three components, we can enhance our communication skills. These exercises are not just theoretical. They're tools that can be applied to daily improve our interactions with colleagues and the like. Remember, the journey to mastering mindful communication is ongoing. It's about continuously learning and adapting. As we move forward, let's keep these key tips in mind, stay present, listen actively without judgment, regulate our responses, and empathize with others. This approach will not only benefit us professionally, but also enrich our personal relationships and overall well being. My name is Vesna, and thank you for your attention.
